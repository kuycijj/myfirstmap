# what did i build?
I built a map based on places that were important to me. The first place marked on this map is "Jail" this place is important to me because this is my school where I get education. The second place I marked on the map is fairyland, It was the first thing that stood out to me and Mx brassey clicked on it. The last place marked on this map is the Mc Donalds right by my school this place means a lot to my friend Eliezer Lopez Isidro. He enjoys going after school sometimes his specific order which is the 5$ meal.

# code spotlight

```
      style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/outdoors-v12',
      center: [-122.1929439740799537, 37.76159586581898],
      zoom: 10
```

when the map first loads this code is the center spotlight which is where the map "spawns" at.
